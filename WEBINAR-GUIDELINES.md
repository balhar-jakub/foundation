# OMP Webinar Guidelines

## Overview

OMP webinars are offered to the community to educate about open source on the Mainframe. Webinars are offered by members, OMP incubating, and graduated projects.
Please note: We are unable to share leads due to the Linux Foundation privacy policy.

## Webinar day and time
Webinars are scheduled for the 3rd Wednesday of the month at 8 am PST.

## Please read the guidelines carefully
We have outlined content guidelines and timelines. Webinars that do not meet the requirements will be canceled.

You must provide your webinar details no later than 4 weeks before the webinar date. At least 2 weeks prior to the webinar date you must provide your complete and final slides.

If the webinar is canceled due to not meeting these guidelines, the member will not be allowed to schedule a webinar in the subsequent webinar period. That is, platinum members may not schedule a webinar in the upcoming quarter and silver members may not schedule a webinar in the upcoming 6 months.

## Who can host a webinar

### Member webinars
* Platinum Members can host 1 webinar per quarter, based on availability.
* Silver members can host 1 webinar every 6 months, based on availability.
* OMP Member webinars will have a "Member webinar" preceding their webinar title.

### Project webinars
* Graduated projects can hold a webinar quarterly and incubating projects can hold a webinar once a year. These webinars can communicate release launch details or provide a project update. OMP project webinars will have a “Project webinar" preceding their webinar title.

## Webinar type definitions
Project webinar: A webinar on a graduated or incubating project. This is presented by or on behalf of the project. If presented by a member about a project, this webinar is classified as a Project webinar. An example is a Zowe webinar presented by the Broadcom team. The webinar is classified as a Project webinar.

Member webinar: A webinar presented by a member. The webinar must comply with the webinar guidelines. A member can present any open source project, including an OMP Sandbox project. If an OMP member presents solely about an OMP graduated or incubating project and on behalf of the project, it is classified as a Project webinar. If the webinar contains information about an OMP graduated or incubating project and includes information on how to do something with that project, it is classified as a Member webinar.

## Webinar content guidelines
* Webinar topics should be comparable to what would be accepted in an Open Mainframe Summit talk.
* Any platforms, tools, or technologies you are describing must be open source.
* Not allowed:
** Sales or marketing pitches
** Unlicensed or potentially closed-source technologies
* Webinars should not be promotional.
* It is NOT okay to mislead or misrepresent features of OMP projects.

Members can add a slide at the end of their webinar on where to get more information. Examples:
* Share contact info of speaker - twitter, slack, email
* Links to company websites
* Links to projects websites or Github
* Can advertise if they are hiring and who to contact if interested

Note: This is not a link to an OMP website or form on the OMP website.

OMP will review the statement, as we do for the content for the webinar, to approve the content. If changes are needed, we will provide suggested changes.

## Webinar Calendar
To choose a webinar date, go to the [OMP Service Desk](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/foundation/issues/new?assignees=chrisblumOMP&labels=webinar&template=webinar-proposal.md&title=OMP+Webinar+-+%5BTITLE%5D) to submit your webinar proposal. This webinar runs the 3rd Wednesday of the month at 8 am PST, please check the accepted webinars before selecting your date. Enter your preferred date. 
Once your proposal is accepted: 
1. Your issue will be moved to the accepted column 
2. You will receive a calendar invite once your webinar has been accepted.  
3. The calendar invite will be updated with the company/project name, which confirms your webinar. 
4. The invite will include the registration link for you to promote your session
5. As it gets closer to the webinar date, an email is sent confirming the webinar date is still good for you and outlines the next steps.

## Webinar Checklist
2 weeks before the webinar date: Share your final webinar slides via the Google Form

Please be aware of these new timelines. We recommend you create a reminder to provide us this information by the due date. If we do not receive the information from you within the timelines outlined, your webinar will be canceled.
If you cannot provide your content via the issue on the [KanBan Board](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/foundation/projects/5) , please email your webinar materials to webinars@openmainframe.org

* Webinar title and abstract
* Speaker Information
* Headshot

* Email addresses for all speakers/panelists
All deliverables should be sent to webinars@openmainframe.org.

## Webinar Promotion & Prep Details
* Upon receipt of the abstract and the webinar being set up in Zoom, the hosting company will receive a link to the webinar registration page. The hosting company should use that link to promote the webinar.
* The webinar is added to the OMP webinar page.
* OMP may promote the webinar via email, newsletters, and social channels.
* Our most successful webinars are when the presenting company helps promote in addition to OMP promotion. We are often able to double our attendance in these cases.

## Webinar: Presentations
* 2 weeks prior to your webinar, upload your final webinar presentation to [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdNNja8FJJw5ZpCF8MzB4IP8w6XmOpGGgCezlbFjdc1049fQ/viewform) . All presentations must be reviewed prior to the webinar.
* NOTE: presentations not received 2 weeks before the webinar date will result in the webinar being canceled.

*** Helpful Notes on Presentation Design
* Obsolete, low-res (i.e., pixelated), and malformatted logos are an epidemic among conference presentations. High-res logos of projects, products, and companies are available in the [Open Mainframe Project artwork repository](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/artwork) or Open Mainframe Project Landscape.The logos are all the most current (or you can open a pull request if they’re not).
* Please see the [branding guidelines](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/branding-guidelines) which covers things like abbreviating Open Mainframe Project as OMP as well as the proper capitalization of projects like Zowe.

## Webinar Moderator
OMP will provide a moderator for the webinar. The moderator is typically an OMP staff member.

The moderator is responsible for covering the housekeeping items and helping the presenter manage the Q&A.

## Webinar: Day-Of Details
* Webinar Prep: ½ hour before the webinar starts. Soundcheck, webinar slides, moderation of the Q&A.
* Live Webinar: Starts at the top of the hour
* Typical timing of the webinar - approximately 5-minute introduction, 45-minute presentation, 10 minutes of Q&A
* OMP staff will help moderate (introduction, feeding questions to the presenter)
* Webinar Platform: Zoom

After the webinar, registration numbers, and a link to the webinar on YouTube will be shared with the company hosting the webinar. OMP does not provide a copy of the webinar recording for individual company use.
Please note: We are unable to share the list of leads or include any promotions with the intention of driving leads.
